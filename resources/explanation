 Synopsis of Infty-CDB-3
*************************

* There are three files included as part of the Infty-CDB-3 database,
  besides this one:
  InftyCDB-3
    |____InftyCDB-3-A.txt
    |____InftyCDB-3-B.txt
    |____OcrCodeList.txt

* The following data is recorded in InftyCDB-3-A.txt and InftyCDB-3-B.txt.
  Fields 1-6 are separated by commas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ID number of source article
2. 2-byte symbol code (written in hexadecimal, using 4 bytes)
3. Character height of bitmap
4. Character width of bitmap
5. Bitmap image, where each 8-bit unit is written as a decimal from 0 to 255
6. Line feed

In the bitmap, black is represented by a 1 bit and white by a 0 bit.
The most significant bit of a byte represents the leftmost pixel.
The last byte in each scanline is padded with 1's, so that each scanline
consumes an integer number of bytes.

Each scanline, from top to bottom, is recorded from left to right:

    char rasterImg[height][byteWidth]//byteWidth=(width+7)/8;

    for(i=0;i<height;i++){
        for(j=0;j<byteWidth;j++)
           fprintf(fp,"%d,",rasterImg[i][j]);
    }

Contents of InftyCDB-3-A.txt and InftyCDB-3-B.txt:

  * InftyCDB-3-A.txt (188,752 symbols):

    This database consists of images of symbols in various fonts,
    and was used to train the character recognition engine in
    recent versions of InftyReader (Ver 2.0-2.5).
    Each symbol has been scanned at 400 dpi.  Depending on when it was
    selected, a symbol may have been scanned into a gray image and then 
    converted into binary images using different thresholds to produce 
    character images of different density from one original sample, 
    while some others are scaned directly into binary image from scaner 
    using medium threshold.

    Images of the symbols come from the following three groups:

    (1) The following publications, from various publishers:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. Journal of Approximation Theory (Academic Press)
   2. Journal of Differential Equations (Academic Press)
   3. Journal of Functional Analysis (Academic Press)
   4. Introduction to Algebraic Curves (American Mathematical Society)
   5. 30 Lectures in Mathematics Series: 30 Lectures on Complex Numbers
      (Japanese, Asakura Shoten)
   6. Complexity Theory of Real Functions (Birkhauser)
   7. Journal of Fluid Mechanics (Cambridge University Press)
   8. Image Processing: Mathematical Methods and Applications (Clarendon Press)
   9. Automorphisms of Affine Spaces (Kluwer Academic Publishers)
  10. Typesetting samples (Kotobuki Printing Co.)
  11. Hyperbolic Manifolds and Holomorphic Mappings (Marcel Dekker, Inc.)
  12. Complex Analysis (Springer-Verlag)
  13. Introduction to Complex Hyperbolic Spaces (Springer-Verlag)
  14. Knot Theory (Japanese, Springer-Verlag)
  15. Rational Points on Elliptic Curves  (Springer)
  16. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics (John Wiley & Sons)
  17. Explanation of Braille Codes for Mathematics
      (Japanese, Japanese Braille Association)
  18. Value Distribution Theory (D. Van Nostrand Co.)
  19. An Introduction to Differentials and Integrals (Yuuseisha)

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Fonts used internally on Windows and Macintosh computers,
        and LaTeX fonts.  These are entered into the database
        by means of scanned printouts.

    (3) Infrequently appearing symbols and fonts are individually
        sought out from mathematics articles in the Kyushu University
        Library.  To our regret, in these cases there is no record
        of the document source.  However, any two symbols that came
        from the same book are always assigned the same article ID number.


  * InftyCDB-3-B.txt (70,637 symbols):

    From 20 mathematics articles (a subset of those used in Infty-CDB-1),
    all of the symbols are extracted at 600 dpi.
    Initially, samples of every symbol code that differ in size are
    taken.  After feature vectors have been computed, clustering is
    used to reduce the redundancy of the samples.  The samples that are
    selected through clustering are entered into InftyCDB-3-B.

    To make the database convenient for the development and testing
    of OCR engines, symbols that look identical in print have been
    assigned the same symbol code.  When InftyCDB-1 was released,
    the summation symbol $\sum$ (for example) was distinguished from
    the Greek letter $\Sigma$; this time, they are treated as identical.
    However, lower and upper case alphabet letters are always given
    different codes, even if they look nearly identical out of context
    (Cc, Oo, Pp, Ss, Vv, Ww, Xx, etc.).

    Furthemore, symbols that look different but are not distinguished
    in mathematical usage ($\epsilon$ and $\varepsilon$, slanted
    and italic, etc.) are assigned the same code.

    Here is a detailed list of characters that are assigned the same code:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fractional line, underbar, overbar, minus, overline, underline,
      lowline, hyphen, longHyphen

    * Single end quotation (') and comma (,)

    * Tilde (\tilde) and similarity (\sim)

    * Vector symbol (\vec) and right arrow (\rightarrow)

    * The following pairs of TeX entities:

        \sum and \Sigma
        \prod and \Pi
        \bigcup and \cup
        \bigcap and \cap
        \bigvee and \vee
        \bigwedge and \wedge
        \bigoplus and \oplus
        \bigotimes and \otimes
        \varepsilon and \epsilon
        \vartheta and \theta
        \varrho and \rho
        \varsigma and \sigma

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * OcrCodeList.txt

    This is the same list that was included with Infty-CDB-1.
    Each symbol code is two bytes; the first represents the
    category (representing the type of symbol, or the style
    of font), and the second represents a character within that category.
    The file lists all symbol codes in order, along with the corresponding
    category names and LaTeX names.

  * Conditions of use

    This database may be used free of charge in the research,
    development, and testing of OCR systems for scientific documents.
    Please refrain from other forms of use.

    You are permitted to use the database for commercial OCR engines.

THE FIRST DATABASE


InftyCDB-3
A Ground Truth Database of Characters, Symbols in Mathematical Documents; Third Distribution, October 24, 2006

    Description:

    InftyCDB-3 is a database of single alphanumeric characters and mathematical symbols, divided into two data sets. Unlike InftyCDB-1 and InftyCDB-2, word and mathematical expression structure is not included. The images are of individual characters only. To make it easy to use for experimentation and development with single-character recognition engines, symbols whose form is identical (for example, the summation symbol and the Greek capital sigma) are assigned the same character code.

    In InftyCDB-3-A, there are 188,752 characters; in InftyCDB-3-B, there are 70,637 characters.

    InftyCDB-3-A is the training set used to produce recent versions of InftyReader (Versions 2.0 - 2.5.0). Taking data from more than 300 sources, we have tried to cover as many varieties of characters and symbols as possible. The data was extracted from books and journals from various publishers, Japanese documents, typesetting samples from printing companies, fonts installed on personal computer operating systems, and LaTeX fonts.

    InftyCDB-3-B is an extract of InftyCDB-1, which includes data from 20 of its articles. To reduce the number of samples with the same character code, size, and shape, clustering was applied to the data from these 20 articles, reducing the number of data samples to about 70,000. The data is written in the same format as in InftyCDB-3-A.

    Please see this explanation for more details.
    Note:

    This data set does not include any German symbols.
    Conditions of use:

    Same as InftyCDB-1.

THE SECOND DATABASE



A Ground Truth Database of Mathematical Expressions, August 12, 2009,

    Description:

    Finding errors in the recognition is an important task in OCR.. This database was prepared to be used in the research and development of the algorithm to find misrecognitions in mathematical OCR.
    InftyProject wishes everyone to use the database to evaluate new verification methods.

    This database was used in the paper "A. Fujiyoshi, M. Suzuki, and S. Uchida, Verification of mathematical formulae based on a combination of context-free grammar and tree grammar, in the proceedings of MKM 2008, pp. 415-429, LNCS(LNAI) 5144, 2008."

    The database was constructed by collecting 3,000 correctly recognized mathematical formulae and 1,400 misrecognized mathematical formulae generated by InftyReader.
    The formulae were collected from 32 pure mathematical articles, in which 30 articles are the same as in InftyCDB-1.
    Each mathimatical formula in the database consist of 10 or more symbols.
    Original images of formulae are available.
    A CSV file with corrected results of misrecognitions, the ground-truthed data for the misrecognized mathematical formulae, is also available.
