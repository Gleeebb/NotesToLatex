for Aaron did not run away. He is unable to communicate his safety to his
parents; he is not deliberately making them suffer} Aaron is a hero,-not a
bad boy.

\ The reunion scene touches deep chords of feeling in. each child or
former child watching the film. Like the story, the'film ends on a note of
family warmth and security. Yet the filmmakers hit on an image to
communicate this reassuring ending which doesn’t occur in the original.
The gray, anxious parents of the opening scene have been transformed in
the final reunion scene to archetypal images of the proud father and the
loving, feeding mother, ladling out the steaming soup (chicken soup, I
trust). The initial. grim image of poverty fades in the glow of plenty. In the
logical working out of the plot, the arrival of cold weather means
business for the furrier father and an end to want, but the emOtional
resolution stems from the festive rejoicing when the child who was lost is
found.

Isaac Bashevis Singer is quoted by Morton A. Reichek (1975) as having
said: “I think the moment you have published a book, it’s not any more
your private property . . . . It belongs already in a way to humanity. If it
has value everybody can ﬁnd in it what he ﬁnds, and I cannot tell the
man I did not intend it to be so . . . . I say to myself, ‘I have done mine, let
them do what they want’ ” (pp. 24, 26). In the case of“Zlateh the Goat,”
Singer certainly did do his part; how fortunate his story was to ﬁnd an
illustrator and ﬁlmmakers as sensitive as Sendak, Schindel, and Deitch.
The ﬁlm achieves excellence as ﬁlm; it is also a remarkably tactful and
creative translation from the medium of print to that of film.

Children’s literature will continue to be a rich source of children’s
ﬁlms, and children will continue to encounter many stories initially in.
their film versions. Those of us Who value both children’s books and ﬁlm
need to step into the critical void that now'exists in this realm. There is a
crying need for intelligent, tough criticism of ﬁlm and television
adaptations of children’s books, with the aims of getting the good films to
the children and sharing with parents and adults who work with

children our conviction that cute, busy ﬁlms may be totally lacking in the
vmfound appeals of the excellent books they feed on.
